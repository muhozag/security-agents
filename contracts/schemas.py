"""
schemas.py

The shared contract between:
  - guardian-service (or ANY security filter that wants to be testable)
  - redteam-cli (or ANY attack tool that wants to test a filter)

Neither component should import from the other directly. Both only
depend on this file. This is what makes the system "any app, any filter"
instead of hardwired to one target as I originally intended.
